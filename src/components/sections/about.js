                        I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented developer with 2+ years of experience in designing and implementing intuitive user interfaces.
                        My proficiency lies in HTML, CSS, Typescript, and JavaScript, and I possess a strong foundation in front-end frameworks such as React and Angular.
                        <br/>
                        My passion is centered around creating visually appealing and user-friendly web applications that consistently deliver exceptional user experiences.
                        <br/>
                        My expertise extends to responsive design principles and ensuring cross-browser compatibility,
                        allowing me to translate wireframes and mockups into pixel-perfect interfaces.
                        I have a track record of effective collaboration with cross-functional teams, including designers and back-end developers,
                        which results in seamless integration and the successful delivery of projects within tight deadlines.</span>
